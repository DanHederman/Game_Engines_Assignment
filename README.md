## Proposal

The idea I have in mind is to create either a wormhole/blackhole or tunnel in which a person/creature will be propelled down with random shapes passing the subject of the program changing colours, 
spinning in differnt directions, this may be changed to the wormhole/black hole changing colours using a colour gradient. The following are the videos that inspired the idea.

## Updated Proposal

The project ended up taking a slightly differnt direction then originally intended. The idea for a tunnel was still kept as the main feature for end product. The idea to have a creature propelled
down the tunnel was scrapped because it would take away from the main focus, the tunnel. Instead it was decided a better approach would be to implement audio features.
