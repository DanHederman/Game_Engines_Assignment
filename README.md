# Game Engines Assignment

**Version 1.0.0**

This is the repository for my game engines assignment

The idea I have in mind is to create either a wormhole or blackhole in which a person/creature will be propelled down with random shapes passing the subject of the program changing colours, spinning in differnt directions, this may be changed to the wormhole/black hole changing colours in a fading type fashion. The following are the videos that inspired the idea.

Californication - Red Hot Chili Peppers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk
Saturnz Barz - Gorillaz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qJp6xlKEug
Do I Wanna Know - Arctic Monkeys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpOSxM0rNPM

I am still trying to fully decide what exactly I am doing, I will update this repo in a few days when I have a better idea of what I actually plan to do.
