## Proposal

The idea I have in mind is to create either a wormhole/blackhole or tunnel in which a person/creature will be propelled down with random shapes passing the subject of the program changing colours, 
spinning in differnt directions, this may be changed to the wormhole/black hole changing colours using a colour gradient. The following are the videos that inspired the idea.

* Californication - Red Hot Chili Peppers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk 
* Saturnz Barz - Gorillaz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qJp6xlKEug 
* Do I Wanna Know - Arctic Monkeys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpOSxM0rNPM

## Updated Proposal

The project ended up taking a slightly differnt direction then originally intended. The idea for a tunnel was still kept as the main feature for end product. The idea to have a creature propelled
down the tunnel was scrapped because it would take away from the main focus, the tunnel. Instead it was decided a better approach would be to implement audio features. The audio features would 
contribute to:

* Controlling the speed of the tunnel
* Adding effects to a spiral(s) going down the centre of the tunnel
* Allowing Audio to be taken in from the mic or from a track directly fed to the program

A colour gradient will be used to alter the colour of both the tunnel and the spirals.
